# TODO

> All items must be numbered (e.g. `## 1. Title`) for easy referencing.

## 1. Favorite folders

Add ability to bookmark folders as favorites. Favorited folders should be displayed at the top of the directory listing, above other folders. Files are not bookmarkable — only folders.

## 2. Copy button for absolute path in info modal

In the file/folder info modal, add a copy-to-clipboard icon button next to the absolute path text.
